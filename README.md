# NorthSouthSystems.BitVectors.WAH

NorthSouthSystems.BitVectors.WAH repository hosts projects containing compressed bit vector data structures using the "Word Aligned Hybrid" scheme and its "Position List" variant. They are developed with .NET and written in C#.

The word aligned hybrid bit vector compression found in this repository was once protected by [United States Patent 6831575](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/10701655) "Word aligned bitmap compression method, data structure, and apparatus". That patent has expired as far as I can tell; however, I am not a lawyer: **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**!
