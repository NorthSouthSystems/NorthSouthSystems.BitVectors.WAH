These .NET libraries contain compressed bit vector data structures using the "Word Aligned Hybrid" scheme and its "Position List" variant.

The word aligned hybrid bit vector compression found in this repository was once protected by [United States Patent 6831575](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/10701655) "Word aligned bitmap compression method, data structure, and apparatus". That patent has expired as far as I can tell; however, I am not a lawyer: **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**!
